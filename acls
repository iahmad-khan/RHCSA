1. Create a second user on the system called "starbuck".  Open a second terminal window into the lab server connected as the user starbuck. Ensure you're working as a priviledged user (sudo) or root user while perofrming the lab. The starbuck user will be used to test setting the permissions.

[root@localhost ~]# useradd starbuck; passwd starbuck

Changing password for user starbuck.

New password: 

Retype new password: 

passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

2. Navigate into the /tmp directory and create two new directories named dir1 and dir2 and two files called file1 and file2.

[root@localhost tmp]# mkdir {dir1,dir2}; touch {file1,file2}

3. Idenity if any of the files currently have extended access control lists associated with them.

[root@localhost tmp]# ls -l

total 0

drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 May  5 20:00 dir1

drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 May  5 20:00 dir2

-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 May  5 20:00 file1

-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 May  5 20:00 file2

Note: The files have base ACLs but do not have extended ACLs. We know they do not have extended ACLs because of no + at the end of the permissions listed.

4. Set an ACL for the starbuck user to read and write for file1

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl -m u:starbuck:rw file1

[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl file1

# file: file1

# owner: root

# group: root

user::rw-

user:starbuck:rw-

group::r--

mask::rw-

other::r--

5. Set the mask on the file1 to read only, then as the starbuck user in your second terminal, attempt to execute the following command echo "test" > /tmp/file1. Explain why this did not work.

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl -m m::r file1

[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl file1

# file: file1

# owner: root

# group: root

user::rw-

user:starbuck:rw- #effective:r--

group::r--

mask::r--

other::r--

Starbuck's Terminal

[starbuck@localhost tmp]$ echo "test "> /tmp/file1

-bash: /tmp/file1: Permission denied

Summary: Starbuck was unable to write to file1 even though starbuck had an ACL with rw the mask was setting the "maximum" permissions to r and was masking w.

6. Set the default permissions on dir1 to read write and execute for the starbuck user  (execute ONLY if it is a directory).

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl -d -m u:starbuck:rwX dir1

[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl dir1

# file: dir1

# owner: root

# group: root

user::rwx

group::r-x

other::r-x

default:user::rwx

default:user:starbuck:rwx

default:group::r-x

default:mask::rwx

default:other::r-x

7. Using setfacl change the "other" permissions to none on file1

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl -m o::- file1

[root@localhost tmp]# ls -l

total 8

drwxr-xr-x+ 2 root root 6 May  5 20:00 dir1

drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 May  5 20:00 dir2

-rw-rw----+ 1 root root 0 May  5 20:00 file1

-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 May  5 20:00 file2

8. Remove the default permissions from dir1

[root@localhost tmp]# setfacl --remove-default dir1

[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl dir1

# file: dir1

# owner: root

# group: root

user::rwx

group::r-x

other::r-x

9. Remove all ACLs on file1

 [root@localhost tmp]# setfacl --remove-all file1

[root@localhost tmp]# getfacl file1

# file: file1

# owner: root

# group: root

user::rw-

group::r--

other::---
