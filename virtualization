1. Download and install the proper packages in order to manage virtual machines on a Red Hat 7 machine. Ensure you install the GUI as well as the command line interface.

[root@localhost]# yum install virt-manager qemu-kvm qemu-img libvirt libvirt-python python-virtinst libvirt-client

OR Note: This is a neat trick

[root@localhost]# yum grouplist hidden // This will show virtualization packages

[root@localhost]# yum groupinstall "Virtualization Client"

[root@localhost]# yum groupinstall "Virtualization Tools"

[root@localhost]# yum groupinstall "Virtualization Platform"

Note: This will prevent you from having to memorize packages or as a backup in the exam if you forget the packages required.

2. Ensure that the virtual machine services start when the system boots and is currently running.

[root@localhost]# systemctl start libvirtd

[root@localhost]# systemctl enable libvirtd

Hint: In the exam if you have to start a service ALWAYS enable the service. 

3. Create a CentOS based virtual machine using the GUI.

[root@localhost]# virt-manager

4. Configure the virtual machine to auto start whenever the system starts. 

[root@localhost]# virsh

[root@localhost]# virsh autostart vmname

OR

At the virsh commandline

Virsh # autostart vmname

5. Reboot and test the configuration.

[root@localhost]# reboot
